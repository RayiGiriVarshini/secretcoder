  <p>Dear Anagha, my friend, so true,<br>

    Though separated by distance, we're connected by heart,<br>
    In memories and laughter, we're never apart,<br>
    Through joys and sorrows, we've walked side by side,<br>
    In each other's presence, love does abide.<br>
    <br>
    Your laughter brings sunshine on cloudy days,<br>
    Your friendship, a treasure that never decays,<br>
    With each passing year, you bloom and grow,<br>
    A beautiful soul, more than you know.<br>
    <br>
    So here's to you, dear Anagha, my friend,<br>
    On your special day, may joy never end,<br>
    May your heart be filled with love and joy,<br>
    And know that you're cherished endlessly.<br>
    <br>
    Though apart we may be, you're always in my heart,<br>
    A bond so strong, it'll never depart,<br>
    Happy 19th birthday, my friend so dear,<br>
